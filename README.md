# Face-Recognition
A complete Face Recognition System built using Python and OpenCV, which supports face dataset creation, training, and real-time face recognition with names. The project uses the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm for face recognition and Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection.
